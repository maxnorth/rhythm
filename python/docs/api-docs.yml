sections:
  - name: Initialization
    description: |
      Initialize Rhythm and configure your application for task execution.

      The initialization process connects to your PostgreSQL database, scans for workflow
      definitions, and prepares the system for executing tasks and workflows.
    examples:
      - title: Basic initialization
        description: Initialize with database connection
        code: |
          import rhythm

          rhythm.init("postgresql://rhythm@localhost/rhythm")

      - title: Custom workflow paths
        description: Specify custom directories containing .flow files
        code: |
          import rhythm

          rhythm.init(
              "postgresql://rhythm@localhost/rhythm",
              workflow_paths=["./workflows", "./custom-flows"]
          )

  - name: Tasks
    description: |
      Define and execute background tasks using the @task decorator.

      Tasks can be called synchronously or queued for asynchronous execution. The decorator
      adds a `.queue()` method to your functions for background processing.

  - name: Client
    description: |
      Client functions for queuing tasks, managing executions, and checking execution status.

      Use these functions to interact with the Rhythm execution system from your application code.

  - name: Worker
    description: |
      Worker functions for processing queued tasks and workflows.

      Workers poll the database for pending executions and process them sequentially.
